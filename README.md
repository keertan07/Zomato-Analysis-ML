 ## Zomato World Data Analysis
This project explores the Zomato restaurant dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights in the global food and hospitality industry. The dataset includes information about restaurants from various countries, and our analysis focuses on answering meaningful business questions that can help food-tech companies, startups, or even food lovers make informed decisions.

 ## 1.Objectives
The main goals of this project are:

# Merge and Clean Data
Combine the Zomato restaurant data with the country code sheet to enable global-level analysis.

# Top Rated Restaurants in Indian Cities

# Votes vs Rating
Analyze the relationship between the number of votes and restaurant ratings — do more votes mean better ratings?

# Restaurant Distribution by Country
Count the number of restaurants listed per country.

# Top 5 Restaurants with Online Delivery
